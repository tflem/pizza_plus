# Pizza Plus

> Welcome to Pizza Plus! I've been using Bootstrap for a number of projects and I'm finding it to be a bit bloated and verbose. With this particular project, I'm getting back to front-end basics. Pizza Plus features the following:

* HTML
* CSS
* Skeleton UI
* jQuery
* Google Maps API

You can view my progress at http://burly-room.surge.sh.
